          <h3>Sign In Screen</h3>
          <p>This screen represents the Google Login Screen</p>
          <p>
            It contains three main components. The background image (powered by
            Unsplash), the Google Sign In Button and the App Logo.

          <h3>Dashboard Screen</h3>
          <p>
            Once the authority has signed in successfully, they are presented
            with the dashboard screen which is divided into two main sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first being the analytics section. This section contains two
            charts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first is a donut chart which shows a high level view of the user
            reports in the authority's zone based on the status (approved,
            submitted, in progress, etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to that is the stacked bar chart which provides a more detailed
            view of the status, but this time based on severity as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            After which users are asked to use a progress indicator to specify
            how severe the reported pothole(s) is(are) according to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second section on the dashboard is a filterable data table
            containing details about the various user reports. This datatable
            has options for sorting, filtering, selecting specific columns,
            searching, exporting the data as csv and printing the table contents
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            On clicking any report in the datatable, the authority is presented
            with the option to update it (status and severity). On pressing
            update they are asked to describe their reason of update in a
            required custom description box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authorities can also comment on the report they clicked on and view
            all the other details of the report as a user would in their My
            Complaints screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are sent notifications through email after any update is made
            on their report.

          <h3>Manage Users</h3>
          <p>
            This screen presents the authority to manage all active users in
            their zone through a filterable data table.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data table contains options to filter, search, sort, select
            columns.
          </p>
          <p>They can view their basic profile details.</p>
          <p>
            They can update their status to either blocked or allowed based on
            their activity too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are sent out email notifications regarding updates in their
            status every time an authority makes a change.

          <h3>Map Region View Screen</h3>
          <p>
            Another screen in the authority app is the map region view section.
            Here they can view potholes reported in their region through an
            interactive map view.
          </p>
          <p>A legend is displayed for helping understand the map better.</p>
          <p>
            Custom markers for potholes with different status values ranging on
            severity are presented to the auhtority on the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            Custom markers for potholes with status approved ranging on severity
            are presented to the user on the route if they are close to the
            route.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authorities can click on any of the markers to view the information
            window for it. On pressing the view button in the info window
            authorities are presented with the view and update detailed report
            section.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can update the status and severity directly from this view
            after clicking the button in the info window. On pressing update
            they are asked to describe their reason of update in a required
            custom description box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authorities can also comment on the report they clicked on and view
            all the other details of the report as a user would in their My
            Complaints screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are sent notifications through email after any update is made
            on their report.
          </p>
          <p>Also, there is a street view renderer for the users.</p>
          <p>
            Finally there is an option to toggle on and off a heat map layer
            which is weighted on the severity of potholes reported in the
            region.
